Table below shows best securities listed in Standard & Poor in terms of buy&hold return over 10 days. It shows the probability to get a profit of 2%+ and the probability of a loss of -2%. 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
top <- read.csv("top.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
